## BASIC USER'S GUIED

### Compute the elapsed time between computations

~~~C++
int main(){
	etime myComputTime;

	myComputeTime.start_timer();

	DoSomeComputation();

	myComputTime.end_timer("My computation lasted: ");
}
~~~
```
My computation lasted: 01:23:03
```
For print in seconds use end_timer():
 
~~~C++
int main(){
	etime myComputTime;

	myComputeTime.start_timer();

	DoSomeComputation();

	cout << "Elapsed time: " << myComputTime.end_timer() << " seconds.\n";
}
~~~
See an example in main.cpp (frequency of primes). Run `make`to build the program.
